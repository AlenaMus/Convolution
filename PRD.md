# Product Requirements Document: Convolution-based Peak Detection

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the product requirements for a Python script that demonstrates peak detection in a sine signal using convolution. The project serves as an educational tool to illustrate a common signal processing technique.

## 2. Goals

*   To provide a clear and understandable implementation of convolution for peak detection.
*   To visualize the process and the results for educational purposes.
*   To create a self-contained script that is easy to run and understand.

## 3. Features

*   **Sine Signal Generation:** The script will generate a sine wave with configurable parameters (periods, samples per period).
*   **Convolution Kernel:** A smaller sine wave segment will be used as a kernel for the convolution operation.
*   **Convolution:** The script will perform a 1D convolution on the generated signal using the kernel.
*   **Peak Detection:** The script will identify local maxima in the convolution result.
*   **Peak Filtering:** A threshold will be applied to filter out insignificant peaks.
*   **Visualization:** The script will generate plots to visualize:
    *   The original sine signal.
    *   The convolution kernel.
    *   The result of the convolution.
    *   The detected peaks on the original signal.
    *   A stem plot of convolution values at peak locations.
*   **Output Files:** The script will save the generated plots as PNG images (`sine_peak_detection.png`, `convolution_at_peaks.png`) and the detected peak indices as a text file (`peak_indices.txt`).

## 4. Technical Requirements

*   **Language:** Python 3
*   **Libraries:**
    *   `numpy` for numerical operations.
    *   `matplotlib` for plotting.
*   **Execution:** The script should be executable from the command line with no additional arguments.

## 5. Out of Scope

*   A graphical user interface (GUI).
*   Real-time signal processing.
*   Advanced peak detection algorithms.
